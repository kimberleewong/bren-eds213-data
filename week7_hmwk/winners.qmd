```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(DBI)
library(duckdb)
library(dbplyr)
```

Let's connect our database
```{r}
conn <- DBI::dbConnect(duckdb::duckdb(), dbdir = "database/database.db")
```

```{r}
egg_table <- tbl(conn, "Bird_eggs")
personnel_table <- tbl(conn, "Personnel")
nests_table <- tbl(conn, "Bird_nests")
```

```{r}
winners <- egg_table %>%

  inner_join(nests_table, by = c("Nest_ID" = "Nest_ID")) %>%
  inner_join(personnel_table, by = c("Observer" = "Abbreviation")) %>% 
  group_by(Name) %>% 
  summarize(egg_count = n()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(egg_count)) %>% 
  head(3) %>% 
  show_query()
             
print(winners)

# The show_query() showed that it did it all in one query and it used the SQL syntax of LIMIT as opposed to R. 
```
